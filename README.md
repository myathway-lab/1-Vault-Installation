# Vault Installation & Use Cases

[Install Vault | Vault | HashiCorp Developer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Vault is an identity-based secret and encryption management system.**

</aside>

> **Use Cases**
> 
- **Secrets Management**
    
    Centrally store, access, and deploy secrets across applications, systems, and infrastructure.
    
- **Encryption Services**
    
    Securely handle data such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, and other types of compliance-regulated information.
    
- **Secrets engines**
    
    Secrets engines are components which store, generate, or encrypt data.
    
    Secrets engines are enabled at aÂ **path**Â in Vault. When a request comes to Vault, the router automatically routes anything with the route prefix to the secrets engine.Â

- **Policies**
    
    Everything in Vault is path-based, and policies are no exception. Policies provide a declarative way to grant or forbid access to certain paths and operations in Vault.
    
    Policies areÂ **deny by default**, so an empty policy grants no permission in the system.

### Vault can be accessed using UI.

### Vault can be accessed using HTTP API.

[HTTP API | Vault | HashiCorp Developer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs)

**Vault has an HTTP API that can be used to control every aspect of Vault.**

**The Vault HTTP API gives you full access to Vault usingÂ [REST like HTTP verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Every aspect of Vault can be controlled using the APIs. The Vault CLI uses the HTTP API to access Vault similar to all other consumers.**

**All API routes are prefixed withÂ `/v1/`.**
